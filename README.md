# Digital Footprints of Substance Use: Decoding Offline Behaviors from Writing Patterns Online

This repository presents the observations and results from a research project conducted at **XU Exponential University of Applied Sciences**. The goal of the project was to analyze substance use behaviors (alcohol, smoking, and drug consumption) through digital footprints, utilizing machine learning techniques applied to the **myPersonality** dataset.

## 📄 Paper Access
The research paper titled **"Digital Footprints of Substance Use: Decoding Offline Behaviors from Writing Patterns Online"** is available in this repository. Please note that the paper is not published yet.

## 🛑 Data Privacy Notice
The **myPersonality** dataset used in this research contains sensitive and proprietary data, and therefore it is **not included in this repository**. Access to the dataset is restricted, and we have received permission from the dataset owner to conduct this research. 

As a result, this repository is intended for **observation and documentation purposes only**. The analysis presented here reflects the insights derived from the data, but the data itself cannot be shared.

## 📝 Observations and Findings
The experiments and analyses documented in this repository include:
- Insights into writing patterns associated with substance use
- Performance evaluation of machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
- Interpretation of linguistic features related to substance use via SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

The Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory illustrate the steps and methodologies used, focusing on **observational insights** rather than reproducibility.
